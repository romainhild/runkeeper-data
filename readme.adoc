Web page to display statistics on Runkeeper data

First, install plotly, with for example conda:
[shell]
----
conda create -n runkeeper-data python="3.8"
conda activate runkeeper-data
conda install -c plotly numpy pandas scipy plotly chart_studio
----

then get the address to download your data in your Runkeeper account, and run
[shell]
----
./dl-data <address>
----
This will generate html files using plotly for the graphs, a javascript file for the table and a php file to access them.

Alternatively, you can watch the graphs using the jupyter notebook.
